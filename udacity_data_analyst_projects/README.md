# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree D3 Visualizations
These are some of the visualizations that I created for the "Data Visualization with D3" course from Udacity. I took this course in 2017 as a step towards getting the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. I would highly recommend anyone interested in D3, data visualizations, data journalism, and data science to look into this course, or at least have a look at what other people have done using it. Most notably the creator of D3 Mike Bostock has created a ton of really great visualizations which can be seen at bl.ocks.org/mbostock, or you could look at his own site bost.ocks.org where he publishes his [medium.com](medium.com) blog posts.
