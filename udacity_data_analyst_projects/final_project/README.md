# Copenhagen Appartment Prices

## Design Decisions
This is the final project in my Udacity Nanodegree D3 course. I have chosen to visualize the data using a choropleth with colors representing price intervals. The map tiles I chose were low key to keep a low data-ink ratio, and the chosen color scheme was Plasma. The visualization uses martini glass storytelling, and has hover functionality so that postal district sales and average sales prices can be seen.

## Data
The data was scraped from Boliga.dk in early 2016, and has not been updated since then. The map for 2016, will therefore not be representative for the entire year of 2016. Futhermore I suspect that Boliga.dk doesn't have all data for all sales in the 1992-2016 period, since it is clear from the visualization that the number of sales per year is very small to begin with, and quite high at the end.

## Data Story
This visualization nicely captures the appartment price growth in copenhagen in the period 1992-2016. It is even possible to see a stagnation in the price development, most likely caused by the housing collapse in 2006 and the following economic crisis, and a subsequent resurgence in price growth.

## Price Growth Driving Factor and Possible Crash
One of the biggest driving factors behind the exponential increase in appartment prices is that you aren't taxed on the profit of a sale. Combine this with regulations in 1989, that increased what is known as "realkredit lån" - realkredit lån is essentially a very low interest loan on appartments - from 60% to 80% of the appartments sales price, as well as the city of copenhagen selling of many of their rental appartments, and what you have is a generation of people buying appartments for a fraction of their market value. These people, because of the zero taxation on profit, have since the early 2000's been able to either buy expensive appartments for their children, through what is called "forældrekøb", which is essentially parent purchase, by taking a loan in their own appartment, or they can invest in some of the expensive new appartments, which coincidentally are popping up everywhere in copenhagen, by simply selling their appartment, often with a 600+% ROI. Given that I see the price development as being way to steep, I do believe that we will see a big correction in the average sales price within the next 5 years.
