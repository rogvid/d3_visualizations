# Weeks in the Life of Rogvi
This visualization shows the weeks and days in my life.
Initially it will only show static colored boxes representing each week in my life.
The idea is that it can be used as a diary/event log where each box will include information logged for that given week.
An example of the information which could be in the first box:
Week 1:
  - Day 1: Born
  - Day 2: Pooped for the first time
Additionally the boxes could also include averages over that weeks various stats. Say that for one week I add information about scores for happiness, exercise, study, family, or work, then the info box for the week could contain both the daily stat and an accumulated and or averaged stat.

The project is hosted on my git page at rogvid.github.io/weeks/
